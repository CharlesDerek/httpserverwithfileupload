# Simple HTTP server with upload functionality
Simple HTTP server with upload functionality written in Python.

Simply run the script by typing `python main.py` on the command line. 
After the server finished starting, open a web browser from another machine and type `<IP_ADDRESS>:8000` on the address bar, where `IP_ADDRESS` is your server's IP address. 
You should now see all of the files contained in the directory you ran the code from and an upload section.
